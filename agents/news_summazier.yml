  # News Summarizer Demo Agent
  This AI agent is designed to automatically aggregate and summarize news over a specified time period. It collects articles from multiple sources, analyzes their content, and produces a concise, structured overview of the most important events and trends.
  The agent can:
  - process large volumes of news data for a selected timeframe (day, week, month, etc.)
  - identify key topics, facts, and recurring narratives
  - remove duplicates and reduce informational noise
  - generate clear, readable summaries focused on what matters most

  The output is a compact yet informative news digest that helps users quickly understand what happened during the chosen period without reading dozens of individual articles. It is well suited for analysts, managers, journalists, and anyone who needs fast, high-level insight into the news agenda.
